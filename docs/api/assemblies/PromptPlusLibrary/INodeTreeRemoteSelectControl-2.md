### INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl&lt;T1,T2&gt; interface
</br>


#### Provides functionality for configuring and interacting with a Remote Node Select Control. This interface enables building and managing hierarchical tree structures with customizable nodes, styles, and interactive selection capabilities.

```csharp
public interface INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl<T1, T2>
    where T1 : class, new()
    where T2 : class
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T1 | Type of Node that represents the data in the tree structure |
| T2 | The type of class that represents a structure capable of storing the data necessary to maintain and search for the next collections of items. |

### Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddRootNode](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/AddRootNode.md)(…) | Adds a root node to the tree structure. The root node serves as the top-level entry point for the tree hierarchy. |
| [ChangeDescription](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/ChangeDescription.md)(…) | Dynamically changes the description of the Remote Node Select Control based on its value. The description updates whenever the selected value changes during interaction. |
| [DisableRecursiveCount](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/DisableRecursiveCount.md)(…) | Disables or enables recursive counting of child nodes in the selection control. Defauts to disabled. |
| [ExtraInfo](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/ExtraInfo.md)(…) | Configures the control to provide show additional information for node. |
| [HideCount](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/HideCount.md)(…) | Controls the visibility of child node counts in the tree display. When enabled, hides the count indicator next to parent nodes. |
| [Options](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/Options.md)(…) | Applies custom options to the control to modify its behavior and appearance. |
| [PageSize](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/PageSize.md)(…) | Sets the maximum number of items to display per page in the tree view. Controls the pagination of large tree structures. |
| [PredicateChildAllowed](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/PredicateChildAllowed.md)(…) | Sets a predicate that determines whether a node of type T1 is allowed to own other nodes. This expression is required for operation. |
| [PredicateDisabled](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/PredicateDisabled.md)(…) | Sets a validation predicate for determining if an item should be disabled. Disabled items cannot be selected or interacted with. |
| [PredicateSelected](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/PredicateSelected.md)(…) | Sets a validation predicate for determining if an item can be selected. (2 methods) |
| [Run](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/Run.md)(…) | Executes the Remote Node Select Control and provides the selection result. Handles user interaction and returns the final selected node. |
| [SearchMoreItems](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/SearchMoreItems.md)(…) | Registers the function responsible for searching and returning the next collection of nodes child items to add to the list.This expression is required for operation. |
| [Styles](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/Styles.md)(…) | Overwrites styles for specific elements of the Remote Node Select Control. Allows customization of visual appearance for different tree components. |
| [TextSelector](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/TextSelector.md)(…) | Sets the function to display text for items in the list. Determines how each node is displayed in the tree structure. |
| [UniqueId](INodeTreeRemoteSelectControl-2/UniqueId.md)(…) | Sets an expression that defines the uniqueId field to string type. This expression is required for operation. |
